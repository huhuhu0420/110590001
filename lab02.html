            <h5>Kirby was created by Masahiro Sakurai as the player character of the 1992 game Kirby's Dream Land (1992). The character's design was intended to serve as placeholder graphics for the game's original protagonist in early development and thus was given a simplistic ball-like appearance. Sakurai switched to the placeholder design for the final character design when he believed that it served the character better.[6] The character was known as Popopo (ポポポ) during development until the name "Kirby" was chosen from a draft list of potential names. Shigeru Miyamoto stated that "Kirby" was chosen in honor of American lawyer John Kirby, who defended Nintendo in the Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd. case in 1984 and that the harsh-sounding name contrasted amusingly with the character's cute appearance.[7][8]</h5>

            <h5>Kirby appears white in Kirby's Dream Land (1992) <br>due to the grayscale palette of the Game Boy system. Sakurai intended the character to be pink, though Miyamoto had originally thought the character to be yellow. Kirby does appear white in the game's North American promotional materials and artwork to reflect the character's in-game appearance.[6] Miyamoto's color choice was repurposed for the second player character in Kirby's Dream Course (1994), and since Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land (2002) has been the default color for a second player Kirby in the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. series. </h5>
            <h5>Kirby has a pink, spherical, body with small stubby arms and large red feet (not shoes).[11] His eyes are a distinctive oval shape and are white (eye shine) at the top, black in the center and dark blue on the bottom (all black in early games) with rosy cheek-blushes near his eyes. His body is soft and flexible, allowing him to stretch or flatten and adopt different shapes, open his mouth very wide to inhale foes, or inflate himself with air and fly. He is 20 cm (about 8 in) tall.[4][12][13] Originally in Kirby's Dream Course (1994) and recurring in several games starting with Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land (2002), different colored Kirbys appear as other players in multi-player games. In the case of Kirby & the Amazing Mirror (2004), they are the result of Kirby being divided into four by Dark Meta Knight.[14]</h5>
